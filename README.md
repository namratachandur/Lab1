# Lab1
Library Management System

This project has two Java classes that allow a user to add, borrow, return and display all available books in a library.

The Book Class includes methods to check if a book is borrowed and allows a user to borrow or return books. 
The Library Class displays a menu to help maintain the list of books with a method to add books.
